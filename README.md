# Apache Beam Demonstration

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the core concepts and usage of **Apache Beam**, a unified programming model for batch and stream data processing.

## üìò Overview

The notebook walks through:
- Setting up an Apache Beam pipeline
- Understanding PCollections and PTransforms
- Applying `Map`, `FlatMap`, and `Filter` operations
- Working with pipelines locally and with runners
- Handling input and output data using Beam I/O connectors

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Install the required dependencies before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install apache-beam notebook
````

Optionally, for running on Google Cloud Dataflow:

```bash
pip install apache-beam[gcp]
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Notebook

1. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook apache_beam_demonstration.ipynb
   ```
2. Run all cells sequentially to follow the demonstration.

## üß† Key Concepts Demonstrated

* **PCollection** ‚Äì The distributed data abstraction used by Beam.
* **PTransform** ‚Äì The processing operations applied to data.
* **Pipeline** ‚Äì The orchestration of transforms from input to output.
* **Runners** ‚Äì Execution backends such as DirectRunner (local) or DataflowRunner (cloud).


```python
options = PipelineOptions(
    runner='DataflowRunner',
    project='YOUR_GCP_PROJECT',
    temp_location='gs://YOUR_BUCKET/tmp',
    region='YOUR_REGION'
)
```

Then execute the pipeline as shown in the notebook.
